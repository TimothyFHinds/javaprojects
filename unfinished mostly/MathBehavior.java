		/* The calculations made with math operations will convert to the type of the assigned variable used. 
		 * The reason that the first line prints 4 and not 4.6 is because java recognizes the math operation as an integer. 
		 * The second line is 4.6 because there is a decimal and a zero after the 5, which makes the operation read as a double. 
		 * I think it is also because the code will default run the most optimal and fast code. Since integer data types use less memory than
		 * the double data type, (32 bits vs 64 bits) java will default to using integers to display the answer.
